## Hi there! I'm Saja the data analyst

I recently finished my internship at [SIRGAD](https://www.sirgad.com/) company, developing PowerBI dashboards and deep analysis for the company's data.
I'm also a Google-certified data analyst (Finished both the intermediate and advanced Google Data Analytics learning paths) and earned the [Data Analyst Badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/4c5a21f0-fea9-4f28-8fa7-a7bee804eb29/public_url) from UNDP & MBRF.
Enough talking about me, you can know all about me from my [C.V. here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZARHhMwCUyCuEEseyZEneuxw05j2lWNg/view?usp=sharing)

I'm currently looking for a data analyst position, you can contact me through my email: sajaahmed617@gmail.com
